Learn Python Basics: Writing Your First Program, Understanding Variables, Comments, and More!

Welcome to of our Python journey! Today, we’ll learn about First Program, Comments, Escape Sequences, Variables, Data Types, and Calculator in Python. Let’s dive in!

First Program :

print("Hello_World")
This prints the text "Hello_World" on the screen.
Example:

print("Hello_World")  # Output: Hello_World

print("Safia Khatoon")
This prints the text "Safia Khatoon" on the screen.
Example:

print("Safia Khatoon")  # Output: Safia Khatoon

print(23)
This prints the number 23 on the screen.
Example:

print(23)  # Output: 23

print(100*20)
This prints the result of multiplying 100 and 20, which is 2000.
Example:

print(100 * 20)  # Output: 2000

What is print?

print is a function in Python that displays output (like text, numbers, or results of calculations) on the screen.

What is a function?

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. In this case, the print function is used to show something on the screen.

Comments in Python

Comments are notes in your code that explain what it does. Python ignores these comments when running the program. They help you and others understand the code better.

Single-line Comment
A single-line comment starts with a #. Everything after # is ignored by Python.
Example:

# This is a comment
print("Hello, Python!")  # This will print a message

Multi-line Comment
You can also write comments on multiple lines using ''' or """.
Example:

'''
This is a 
multi-line comment
'''
print("Multi-line comments are useful!")

2. Escape Sequences

Escape sequences are special characters used to represent things that are hard to type directly, like new lines or tabs. They start with a backslash (\).

\n – New line
Moves to a new line.
Example:

print("Hello\nWorld!")

\t – Tab
Adds a tab space.
Example:

print("Hello\tWorld!")

\\ – Backslash
Prints a single backslash.
Example:

print("This is a backslash: \\")

\' – Single quote
Prints a single quote.
Example:

print("It's a beautiful day!")

\" – Double quote
Prints a double quote.
Example:

print("She said, \"Hello!\"")

3. Characters in Python

In Python, characters are simply strings of length 1. For example, 'a' or 'b' are characters. Strings can contain letters, numbers, or special characters.

Example:

char = 'A'
print(char)  # Output: A

Variables and Data Types

What are Variables?
A variable is like a box where you store information (data) to use later.
Example:

x = 5  # 'x' is a box holding the value 5

Data Types in Python

Data types tell Python what kind of information is stored in a variable.

int (Integer)
Numbers without a decimal.
Example:

age = 25

float
Numbers with a decimal.
Example:

price = 19.99

str (String)
Text or characters inside quotes.
Example:

name = "Safia"

bool (Boolean)
True or False values.
Example:

is_active = True

list
A collection of items in square brackets.
Example:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

tuple
Like a list, but you can't change the items (immutable).
Example:

coordinates = (10, 20)

dict (Dictionary)
Stores data in key-value pairs.
Example:

student = {"name": "Safia", "age": 25}

None
Represents "nothing" or "empty."
Example:

result = None

Key Points

Use = to assign a value to a variable.

Python automatically decides the data type based on the value.
Example:

x = 10       # int
y = "hello"  # str

Operators in Python

Operators are symbols used to perform operations on values or variables. Here's a simple breakdown:

1. Arithmetic Operators

Used for basic math.

Operator

Meaning

Example

Result

+

Add

5 + 3

8

-

Subtract

5 - 3

2

*

Multiply

5 * 3

15

/

Divide

5 / 2

2.5

//

Floor Division

5 // 2

2

%

Modulus (Remainder)

5 % 2

1

**

Exponentiation

2 ** 3

8

Create a Calculator :

print("Create A Calculator Using Python")

# Input two numbers from the user
a = float(input("Enter Your First Number: "))
b = float(input("Enter Your Secound Number: "))

# Perform calculations
add = a + b
sub = a - b
mul = a * b
div = a / b 

# Display results
print("Addition Of Two Number Is: ", add)
print("Subtraction Of Two Number Is: ", sub)
print("Multiplication Of Two Number Is: ", mul)
print("Division Of Two Number Is: ", div)
