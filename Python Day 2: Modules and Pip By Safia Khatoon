What is Modules ?

Modules are used to borrow someone elseâ€™s code .

There are 2 Types of module :

Built-in Modules: Built-in modules are modules that do not need to be installed externally; they are already included with Python.

example : math, random, os, etc.

External Modules: External modules are those modules that you install from the internet. For example, in your home, the kitchen is like a built-in module, and the kitchen items like sugar, milk, and rice are like external modules.

Example: pandas, numpy, flask, django

What is pip ?

It installs modules from the internet.

Practical:

write pip in your command line

pip install pandas

How to Uninstall Modules:

pip uninstall pandas

What is the difference between command line tools and Replit?

In command line tools, errors can occur, but in Replit, it's more convenient to use. If you install a module from the internet, you simply write import <module_name>, and it's installed and imported without needing to write pip install <module_name>.

what is import ?

In Python, import is used to bring in code from other files or libraries so you can use it in your program.
